-  The Deployment "nginx-deploy" is invalid: spec.selector: Invalid value: {"matchLabels":{"env":"dev"}}: field is immutable
    - means that you're trying to modify the .spec.selector field of an existing Deployment, which is not allowed in Kubernetes after the Deployment has been created.
    - The spec.selector defines which Pods the Deployment manages. This is immutable after creation because changing it could cause Kubernetes to associate the Deployment with a completely different set of Pods — which is unsafe.
- How to Fix It
    - Option 1: Delete and Recreate the Deployment
    - Option 2: Use a New Deployment Name
