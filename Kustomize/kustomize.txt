Kustomize is a tool for customizing Kubernetes configurations. It allows users to create and manage Kubernetes manifests in a more flexible and 
reusable way by using a concept called "overlays" to modify base configurations without altering the original files.

Here are some key features of Kustomize:
1. **Base and Overlays**: Kustomize uses a base configuration that can be modified by overlays. 
This allows users to create different variations of the same base configuration for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
2. **Resource Customization**: Users can customize resources by adding, modifying, or removing fields in the Kubernetes manifests without changing 
the original files.
3. **Patching**: Kustomize supports strategic merging and JSON patches, 
allowing users to apply changes to specific fields in the manifests.
4. **Generators**: Kustomize can generate resources like ConfigMaps and Secrets from files or literals, 
making it easier to manage configuration data.
5. **Built-in Functions**: Kustomize provides built-in functions for common tasks, 
such as name prefixing/suffixing, label management, and namespace setting.
6. **No Templating Language**: Unlike other tools, Kustomize does not use a templating language,
    making it simpler to understand and use for those familiar with standard Kubernetes manifests.
To use Kustomize, you typically create a `kustomization.yaml` file that defines the resources to be included,
patches to be applied, and any generators to be used. You can then run Kustomize commands to build the final manifests for deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.
Example `kustomization.yaml` file:
```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - deployment.yaml
  - service.yaml
patchesStrategicMerge:
    - patch.yaml
configMapGenerator:
    - name: my-config
        files:
        - config.properties
namespace: my-namespace
namePrefix: dev-
labels:
    app: my-app
```
In this example, the `kustomization.yaml` file specifies two resources (`deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml`),
applies a strategic merge patch (`patch.yaml`), generates a ConfigMap from a properties file,
sets the namespace to `my-namespace`, adds a prefix `dev-` to resource names, and applies a label `app: my-app` to all resources.   
To build the final manifests, you would run the following command:
```bash
kustomize build .
```
This command processes the `kustomization.yaml` file in the current directory and outputs the customized Kubernetes manifests.
