Ingress in kubernetes is a resource that manages external access to services within a cluster, 
typically HTTP and HTTPS traffic. 
It provides a way to define rules for routing traffic to different services based on the request's host or path. 
Ingress can also handle SSL termination, load balancing, and name-based virtual hosting.
Here is an example of a simple Ingress resource definition in YAML:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: minimal-ingress
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx-example
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /testpath
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: test
            port:
              number: 80
In this example, the Ingress resource named "minimal-ingress" routes HTTP traffic with the path "/testpath" to a backend service named "test" on port 80.
To apply this Ingress resource to your Kubernetes cluster, you would typically save the YAML definition to a file (e.g., ingress.yaml) and then use the kubectl command-line tool to create the resource:
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
Make sure you have an Ingress controller (like NGINX, Traefik, etc.) deployed in your cluster to handle the Ingress resources and route the traffic accordingly.
Remember to customize the Ingress resource according to your specific requirements, such as adding host rules, TLS settings, or additional paths as needed.
