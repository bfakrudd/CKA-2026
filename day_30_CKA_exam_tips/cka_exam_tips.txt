   - Troubleshooting common issues
    - Sample exam questions and answers
         The number of questions: 16
         The number of tasks in each question are increased now. 
         Most of the questions were from Configuration and troubleshootings. 
         The 2 hours time seems very less. 
         The biggest challenge i faced during CKA was that even documentation doesn't contain the info about the installations they ask us to perform. 
         Highly disatisfied with CKA experience. Even if you revise the networking and troubleshooting again and again still it is difficult to 
         identify the root cause of the problem in the given time. 
         Note:- I was able to complete 9 questions. for other 7 questions, 
         either i could complete just one task or couldn't even start at all.
6. Final Preparations
   - Review key concepts and commands
   - Get a good night's sleep before the exam
   - Ensure a stable internet connection and a quiet environment for the exam
